# My project's introduction
In my diverse portfolio of projects, I have applied a range of technologies and methodologies across various domains. I adopted SQL for efficient database design and retrieval, and leveraged R for comprehensive data wrangling tasks. To support strategic business decisions, I built a detailed business case for a car renting firm, further employing Kanban to create Personas, User Stories, and Acceptance Criteria. I utilized Power BI to analyze business cases and developed self-service analytics solutions in emerging industry segments such as Nutraceuticals, Cosmeceuticals, and Nutricosmetics.

In terms of data visualization, I used both Tableau and SAS Viya to transform complex datasets into actionable insights. Additionally, I applied descriptive analytics techniques using Excel to address real estate buyer advocacy challenges.

My predictive modeling expertise includes the use of R, Python and SAS Enterprise Miner to build and evaluate models for online car sales, along with customer segmentation, income and association rule mining. I also explored Python to build decision tree models for wine classification and image classification tasks. My AI-driven initiatives include building a chatbot using Dialogflow CX and classifying comments using Large Language Models (LLMs) in Python.

Finally, I conducted Azure cost analysis and budgeting, further demonstrating my ability to manage cloud-based resources effectively.
